    "intent": "110.1",

  },
  {
    "intent": "110.2",
    "remark": "Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space there's not a lot of oxygen."

  },
  {
    "intent": "110.2",

    "intent": "110.2",

  },
  {
    "intent": "110.2",

  },
  {
    "intent": "110.2",

    "intent": "110.3",
    "remark": "Well, that's awesome."
  },
  {
    "intent": "110.3",
    "remark": "So maybe you can help us teach others since you know."
  },
  {
    "intent": "110.3",
    "remark": "I'm sure they do, and I bet that you could probably tell you more and you can share that information together."
  },
  {
    "intent": "110.3",
    "remark": "Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you."
  },
  {
    "intent": "110.3",
    "remark": "Or maybe you could see if your classmates, maybe they don't know it, and they need your help."
  },
  {
    "intent": "110.4",
    "remark": "So the machine was the Lunar Orbiter."

    "intent": "110.4",

    "intent": "110.4",

  {
    "intent": "120.1",
    "remark": "Okay."
  },

    "intent": "120.1",
    "remark": "So I want you to read over that for a minute and see if anything sticks out that is believable is it convincing that water is a valuable resource."
  },
  {
    "intent": "120.1",
    "remark": "So take a minute to do that."
  },
  {
    "intent": "120.1",
    "remark": "Yeah, and you also hit on that to do you have a question or a comment you wanted to add"
  },
  {
    "intent": "120.2",
    "remark": "All right, so the question was 'what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?'"
  },
  {
    "intent": "120.2",
    "remark": "We're trying to figure out what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon?"
  },

    "intent": "120.2",
    "remark": "Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?"
  },

    "intent": "120.2",
    "remark": "Reach Every Reader: Oh, no, no, it talks about the craters not the equipment So we need to find the equipment that they used"

    "intent": "120.3",
    "remark": "Would you like to read the second paragraph?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "120.3",

    "intent": "120.3",

    "intent": "120.3",

    "intent": "120.4",
    "remark": "What are you thinking about the question?"
  },

    "intent": "120.4",

    "intent": "120.4",
    "remark": "Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.1",
    "remark": "So a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.1",
    "remark": "You've got a piece of it."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.1",

    "intent": "130.1",
    "remark": "You're both partially right."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.1",
    "remark": "They used a small machine to investigate craters and a microscope to look closely at the water."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "I wonder, maybe you can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer."
  },

    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "student, I want you to find the name of the machine for us."
  },

    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "Can you explain what discover'means?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "Yes, student?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "And she said, NASA sent a small machine."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "Would anyone else like to build on his response?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "Right, you find something."

    "intent": "130.2",

    "intent": "130.2",

    "intent": "130.2",

  },
  {
    "intent": "130.2",

    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "With a partner read the text again and see if you can find the answer."

    "intent": "130.2",
    "remark": "Work in small groups to compare your answers."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "So, they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "That's just part of their work uniform and protective clothing."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate."
  },

    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.\""
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "So, this is the machine that actually went and explored."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "They didn't really use a microscope to find the water."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "The water was located underneath the ground."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "So, to make our answer better, we could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "Discover is when we find it."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "So, do you understand how we could improve your answer?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "Well, if we look back in the number three it says, that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "The water they found is microscopic."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "So the water is very small."
  },
  {
    "intent": "130.3",
    "remark": "But I do think based on paragraph five, whenever it talks about using the oxygen in the hydrogen and breaking it up to use it for a different things."

    "intent": "130.3",

    "intent": "140.1",
    "remark": "Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "140.1",

  },
  {
    "intent": "140.1",
    "remark": "Did you like using the microscope in science class?"
  },
  {
    "intent": "140.1",
    "remark": "When you deposit something, how much do you deposit?"

    "remark": "Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know."
  },

    "intent": "140.1",

  {
    "intent": "150.1",

    "intent": "150.1",

    "intent": "150.1",

  },

    "intent": "150.1",

  },

    "intent": "150.1",
    "remark": "So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you."
  },
  {
    "intent": "150.1",
    "remark": "Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully."
  },
  {
    "intent": "150.1",
    "remark": "Huh."
  },
  {
    "intent": "150.1",
    "remark": "But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too."

    "remark": "Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question."
  },
  {
    "intent": "150.1",
    "remark": "That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friend's answer is we can learn even more."
  },

    "remark": "Well, it's expensive to send people to the moon all of the time."
  },

  },
  {
    "intent": 210.1,
    "remark": "Part of the reason scientists are so interested in finding water on other planets is because we living things need water to survive."

    "remark": "Yeah, that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space."
  },

    "intent": 210.2,
    "remark": "So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon."
